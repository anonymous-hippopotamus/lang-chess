The square a3 is empty.\n        - To the right: The pawn can move to c3. The square c3 is occupied by a white Knight, so this move is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the legal moves for the pawn at b2 are:\n- Moving forward to b3\n- Moving forward to b4\n- Capturing diagonally to the left to a3\n\nIn UCI notation, these moves are represented as follows:\n- Moving forward to b3: `b2b3`\n- Moving forward to b4: `b2b4`\n- Capturing diagonally to the left to a3: `b2a3`\n\n</think>\n\n<think>\nVerifying again...
